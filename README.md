# PerceptroninJava
Perceptron Neural Network: receives inputs, which are the samples (inputs), each input is multiplied by a weight (synaptic) and all results are summed, the value of this sum passes through an activation function (sigmoid, hyperbolic tangent, gausian) , then generates an output value (output of the perceptron) that is compared with the desired value, not being the expected, the weights will be readjusted for a new iteration, this readjustment process is performed several times until the network presents the desired result, and so, this neural network will be trained.
